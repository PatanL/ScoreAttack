# Score Attack: Balatro Multiplayer Experience in Singleplayer

Mimics balatro multiplayer ruleset in single player

## Key Features

*   **Score Attack Boss Blind**: After Ante 1, all Boss Blinds are replaced with a "Score Attack" round. In these rounds, you cannot lose a life, and your goal is to score as many points as possible (or do whatever you want).
*   **"The Order" Inspired Reworks**:
    *   **Hanging Chad Rework**: Retriggers the first **and** second card played for scoring.
    *   **Glass Card Rework**: Balanced to provide **1.5x Mult** with a **1 in 4** chance of breaking.
*   **Removed Cards**:
    *   **Justice** (Tarot) is banned.
    *   Vouchers that allow rerolling boss blinds (`Director's Cut`, `Retcon`) are banned,

*   **Multiplayer Joker Pack**: All Multiplayer-exclusive jokers (like Defensive Joker, Skip-Off, Pizza, and more) are added to the item pool, but they aren't implemented perfectly. (penny pincher only gives $5, defensive joker doesn't give any chips)
